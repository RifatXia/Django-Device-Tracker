kindly install the required dependencies accordingly using pip

the api endpoints have been created to test them out and works as follows:
django admin - http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
device checkout - http://127.0.0.1:8000/device/device_checkout/1/1/
device return - http://127.0.0.1:8000/device/device_return/1/1/

there would be no rendering of the html files since I didn't work on the frontend
