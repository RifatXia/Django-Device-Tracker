kindly install the required dependencies accordingly using pip

move to the project directory using cd and create super user accordingly
flood the database accordingly and run the project using 'python manage.py runserver' and
access django admin and the api endpoints accordingly

the api endpoints have been created to test them out and works as follows:

django admin - http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

device checkout - http://127.0.0.1:8000/device/device_checkout/1/1/

device return - http://127.0.0.1:8000/device/device_return/1/1/

there would be no rendering of the html files since I didn't work on the frontend
